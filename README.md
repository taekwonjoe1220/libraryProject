This project is part of The Odin Project (TOP)

Part 1 is to create constructor funciton that stores information about books inside of an object. (WORKING)

Part 2 is to create a function to loop over the array of book objects and display them on the page. (WORKING)

Part 3 is to add a "New Book" button that adds to the list and updates the display. (WORKING)

Lastly, add a delete button inside of each book's display card to remove it from the array and re-render the page with only the remaining books. (WORKING)

I completed this while working on a work laptop and was lazy about pushing to github so it looks like I coded this in one sitting. Realistically it took me 4-5 settings to work through each portion.
